# 🚀 NLP-Based Categorization of Space Mission Abstracts

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to automatically **categorize space mission abstracts** into meaningful categories.  
It helps researchers, students, and space agencies quickly analyze and organize large volumes of mission-related textual data.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Space agencies like NASA and ISRO publish thousands of mission abstracts.  
Manually classifying these abstracts is:
- Time-consuming  
- Error-prone  
- Not scalable  

This project solves that problem by using **machine learning and NLP** to classify abstracts automatically.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess and clean space mission text data
- Extract meaningful features using NLP techniques
- Train a machine learning model for text classification
- Visualize data insights using interactive charts
- Provide a user-friendly interface using Streamlit

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Streamlit
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - plotly
  - nltk / sklearn NLP tools
